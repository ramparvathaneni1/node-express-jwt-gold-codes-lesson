# express-starter

Express starter code for CODA, intentionally includes node modules

- `npm install jsonwebtoken express-jwt`
- We're using a npm package called dotenv to set up an environment variable secret key for our token. In the root
  of the starter folder, touch `.env` and add the `JWT_SECRET` below (it could be anything).
